Triage Facility and Heaps

Description of Program: I am constructing the data structure called
heap. I am using heaps to organize objects such as tuples and strings. I am
using heaps to create a Triage Facility setting so there is an ordered list
of patient to see who should be serviced first. Heaps are useful for this
because it compares a certain trait such as priority to see who is first in
the list.

3. Features: In the Heap class, there are methods that arranges based on 
heap rules, get the root, remove root from heap, increase priority, add
nodes into the heap, get number of nodes in heap. StringHeap class
has similar functionalities but its based on organizing strings and cannot
add strings and increase priority. The Sorting classes sort the heap in
ascending or descending order. TriageFacility utilizes the heap and sorting
classes to order the patients based on priority and extract the info.
